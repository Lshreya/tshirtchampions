<strong>It's Time for an Attitude Adjustment</strong><br/><br/>
February 2011<br/><br/><br/>




How many hours a day are we engaged with our jobs, with our co-workers? For most of us it's gotta be somewhere between 7-12 hours a day. Some of us do this 6-7 days a week too. All together now, that's an average of 50-60 hours a week. That is at least 40% of every waking hour of our lives. I think about this stuff now.
<br/><br/>
When I was younger I took time for granted. It’s only natural. I always thought I had time. Time is one of those variable facts of life that make us all equal. We all have the same amount of time, or do we? Some of us are not as equal in the way we choose to spend it. More on time later….
<br/><br/>
Attitude is another one of those variable components of life. There are millions of quotes on attitude.
<br/><br/>
“It’s the only real thing each of us own”
<br/><br/>
“I had the blues because I has no shoes until upon the street I met a man who had no feet” Ancient Persian Proverb
<br/><br/>
“So often time it happens, we live our lives in chains, and we never even knew we have the key.” The Eagles
<br/><br/>
“If you don’t think every day is a good day, just try missing one.” Cavett Roberts
<br/><br/>
Most of us think we can fool people with our attitude. But when we are working within a team or living with our family 12-24 hours a day, can we really? I’ve finally come to know I can’t fool anyone.

Which one are you going to choose today? From the book Fish by Stephen C. Lundin.
<br/><br/>
The point I’m trying to make is we all have very limited time to be at our best with the ones we love.
<br/><br/>
Of course, I had to learn this the hard way. I always thought I could repair relationships with folks when I didn’t treat them as well as I should. I haven’t always treated the people around me with respect.
<br/><br/>
About 4 years ago, seems like yesterday, my wife told me, she would rather me leave than stay. She was finally tired of my selfish non-respectful behavior, especially towards her. I was devastated. How could this happen to me? I spent the next 8 weeks crying, begging, and searching for the answer. Do I move on, or is she going to give me another chance? I’m sure many of you have gone thru this trauma. Let it be known, this was all on me. She had “ put her foot down” many times before, but this was for real. After some counseling, and major introspection I read something that struck home to me. “ If you don’t like yourself, how can you love the one your with?” We all have had trauma in our lives. Get over it! Also, treat each other as if you’re being filmed on YouTube and the whole world can see. These facts and more led me back to ask my wife for forgiveness. I am proud to say we are better than ever. We are celebrating 30 years of marriage this year!
<br/><br/>
“Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves miserable, or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same.” Francesca Reigler.
<br/><br/>
So, don’t wait till you lose a family member, a co-worker, or a friend to improve your attitude. If you are unhappy, get help! You’re not foolin anyone! And yes, I love my family, co-workers and friends. Time is fleeting. Don’t wait until it's too late for an attitude adjustment.
