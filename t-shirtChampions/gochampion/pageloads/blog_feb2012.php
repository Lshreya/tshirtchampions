    <br />
February 2012</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Last month I wrote about setting goals for the coming year. I had planned on an article this month of &quot;Goals are Set, Now what&quot;? But, I humbly interrupt this plan. I can because I decided last year not to be so serious with this advice. After all, I began this blog purely for the pleasure of recording some of the experiences I have obtained over the last 35 years of business and life. So this month, I impart to you some serious humility! Ha!</p>
  <p><br />
        One Saturday morning at 5:00 a.m., I was definitely not awake. My wife, 3 dogs and I abruptly awakened to the ADT alarm, Fire, Fire, Fire!  Yes, we were jarred out bed with our house filled with smoke. Thirty minutes earlier, thunder and lightening had shaken the house. This is not unusual, living along the Wolf River. That does makes 3 strikes in 15 years! It may be time for a lightning rod.</p>
  <p><br />
        I, in my infinite wisdom, grabbed the flashlight and searched our 5 attics for the source. (Could have killed an architect about that time) No fire! I then heard the loudest scream I've ever heard from my wife &quot; the stove is on fire.&quot; She's the smart one, as she grabbed the dogs and headed to the back porch. Now keep in mind I was wearing nothing but a flashlight, not even shoes. At that moment, I'm trying to make the difficult decision to get dressed or put out a fire. Yes, humility is beginning to sink in.</p>
  <p><br />
        I decide to grab a pan of water and throw it on the stove. The fire does not go out!! I then get a screwdriver and hammer to lift the stovetop. I jam the tools in between the oven top to find the flame. I see a burning gas line!  I then throw two pans of water on it. Folks, don't replicate anything you read here. Thank goodness, the fire was extinguished and the house didn't explode. Also to my relief, I hear fire engines outside. Now, I realize is the time to get dressed.</p>
  <p><br />
        I have never been so relieved to see Firemen. The last time I needed them I was ten. One of my best friend's house burned to the ground. That is something you never forget.  The Firemen immediately checked the gas source and shut off the emergency switch. Yes folks, I went and got dressed while leaving the small detail of leaking gas.</p>
  <p><br />
        Now at this moment, humility, thankfulness, joy, were all encompassing. I could have blown up the whole house!!!! The Firemen of Station 61, Lt. Campbell and his crew proceeded to inspect our house from top to bottom. They even removed the stove and burnt wood cabinets to the garage. They called MLGW (who arrived in less than 20 minutes) to check the house for any further weaknesses in electrical and gas lines. Lt. Campbell and his men were most thorough and reassuring!  Everything checked out and all was over in less than 4 hours, except the mess and the blown out water line. (Another story) I have not been that humble and grateful since my children were born perfect and Suzie was safe.</p>
  <p><br />
          Suzie and I were both exhausted. She goes back to bed at 11:00 that morning. I cannot sleep for realizing how lucky I am. I also ask myself profoundly, &quot;Why do we suddenly become humble when we need help? We are mostly humble when we are afraid we are going to lose something. Why don't we stay humble more often?&quot; It's because we get so caught up in our daily lives that we don't remember what is most important to us. Just then I remembered, family, friends, team members, customers are all important to the quality of my life. Stay humble and you may keep them happier. I know I can be humble better than putting out a fire!!</p>
  <p><br />
         &quot;I claim to be a simple individual, likable to err like any other Fellow mortal. I own however, that I have Humility enough to confess my errors and to retrace my steps.&quot; Mahatma Gandhi</p>
