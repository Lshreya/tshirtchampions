<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new year began!&nbsp; Isn't it Grand? For us old codgers who have practiced the art of goal setting for years, it's not so bad. But for the younger set it can be very tough! More about this in a minute....</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, let me tell you about our wonderful vacation. It is a Bowen Family tradition to travel together&nbsp;each year,&nbsp;after New Year's Eve.&nbsp; This can be hard because three&nbsp;of us work together. Also, My younger son, Michael,&nbsp;is in his last semester of U of M and is studying real hard to go to Law School. Plus, by the time the holidays are over, (thirty five relatives later) and The Liberty Bowl activities are complete, (sixty&nbsp;hour&nbsp;work- a- thon) we are all just dog-tired! My wife is the greatest travel planner in the world or we would all probably sleep for a week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For over 25 years, we normally go out west and visit my Aunt and Uncle in Boise, Idaho or&nbsp;Salt Lake City,&nbsp;Utah. We go skiing, shopping and sleeping, not necessarily in that order. We do the expected three - four day&nbsp;visit at their house and then off to our rental house for the week to some ski resort. This year it was Sun Valley in Ketchum, Idaho. It is an old mining town that has kept its charm. It claims to be the first Ski resort built in the USA in 1937 .It is also Ernest Hemingway's burial place. Great mountains, good snow, if we're lucky, hot tubs and fantastic views.&nbsp; We can get on each other's nerves&nbsp;living together again&nbsp;under one roof for 9 days!&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;do have a fantastic time as long as my rich wife (inside joke) pays for everything.&nbsp;I really do cherish the time spent alone with my two grown sons in a gondola climbing a majestic mountain to watch them totally beat me down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do take that time to sneak in some career and goal setting&nbsp;talk.&nbsp; By the way,&nbsp;they&nbsp;don't stop me as much as they used to. Somehow,&nbsp;they have learned that it is like everything else. Goals come easier with Practice, Practice, and Practice. This year,&nbsp;before our trip,&nbsp;a major topic was the dreaded LSAT and&nbsp;Law School for my younger son. (As of this date, he&nbsp;has been accepted to U of M Law!) Yes, I am bragging here, because he is in the eighth year of an eleven-year goal. He gets goal setting!&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I knew it, we had left out my older son's goals in a lot of the discussions. Back in November, I found this out the hard way. &nbsp;I was elated and telling everyone at work of the younger son's LSAT score and in walks Colby, the elder son. "Oh, are ya telling them about the chosen one, the Golden Child again" he claims he said in jest. I realized a little too late, as most Dads do,&nbsp;that I have not celebrated&nbsp;his goals or achievements nearly enough! I had forgotten the first rule of Goal Setting! Goals,&nbsp;no matter how small, must be continually reinforced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colby, like his Dad, took awhile to learn how to set goals. He&nbsp;had finally set a goal in November to learn how to become a Sales Manager for Champion. He had already accomplished the goal of managing our retail store. He increased sales&nbsp;10% at Beale Street&nbsp;Gift Shop&nbsp;in 2011. &nbsp;I had forced&nbsp;this&nbsp;new challenge on him a little. He will probably say a lot. Nevertheless, I had not celebrated it nearly enough. So, I got him good at our yearly awards luncheon. Yes, we still have one each year. &nbsp;I have written how a small plaque, given at the right time, can play a major role in someone's career. As I was presenting Colby his annual award, I mimicked his&nbsp;"Chosen One" story. I explained to all our Team that he had really been the "Chosen One" all along. I am the proud father&nbsp;of the future of our company. We did do a pretty good job of hiding our tears as we hugged! He and Michael, still have a lot of work ahead of them. But, they both realize now that Goals can be set and met, no matter how long it may take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Practice this easy method of setting goals for 2012:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Set six professional goals with focus on improving yourself, customers, and team members.</p>
<p>• Set six personal goals with focus on improving yourself, relationship with family and friends and community.</p>
<p>• Set small attainable measurable goals with deadlines. If you miss the deadline, set a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Celebrate in some small way your successes. Treat yourself! Do not worry about missing deadlines.</p>
<p>• Hand write them down and carry them with you and check them weekly!&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Practice, Practice, Practice! Complete and Celebrate! Repeat!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the hardest goals in life is to master the effort of improving everyday and feeling good about your effort." Mike Bowen, Proud Dad.</p>
