			<i>Power of One (Part IV)</i><br/><br/>
<strong>The Power of the Customer</strong><br/><br/>
April 2010<br/><br/><br/>



Can you believe it! Our small family business, Champion Awards and Apparel, just passed our fortieth year in business in February of 2010. We have not only survived but also thrived. We have been profitable 37 out of 40 years. Sometimes small profits, but profits nonetheless. We couldn't have accomplished this success without great customers, great employees and great vendors.
<br/><br/>
  In past columns, I have written about some of our absolutely fantastic employees that have changed my life for the better. Today's Power of One is about the most important aspect of any business....THE CUSTOMERS! Especially the profitable customers!!
<br/><br/>
  Over forty years ago my Mom and Dad, with $2,000, started Champion Trophy in a small barn off Germantown Rd. and Raines Rd. in east Shelby County. Now that was in the sticks. Within two years, Mom took over the company and my dad kept his day job. She moved the company to the corner of Winchester and Mendenhall, in Parkway Village. She had 750 sq. feet and a real sign. We thought that sign was the coolest thing ever. She was next to the Speedee Convenience Store and leased from Mr. Novick. They were the only businesses east of Perkins Rd. in 1972! Mom's bread and butter were saddle clubs, horse shows, little league sports, bowling leagues, churches and schools.
<br/><br/>
  Very few businesses were rewarding employees with awards back then. By 1978 she had grown the business to over $100,000 a year. Mom was making a great living with her 2 employees by servicing the community.
<br/><br/>
  Then it seemed the Power of One hit in 1979. An administrative assistant to a Vice President of a little start up company down the road came in to the store. She said her boss needed over 1,000 plaques. It was a $25,000 order! WOW! This was by far the largest order Mom had ever received, especially for plaques. Well naturally everyone in the family and friends helped make those plaques and deliver on time. Because with this company, the quality, time sensitivity, and budget had to be absolutely, positively correct. The next year, Larry McMahon, the VP came in himself.  He brought even more business. Not only did he double the order but he had told another VP as well. Within four years Champion Awards was doing all four regional VP's Safe Driving, Perfect Attendance and Bravo Zulu awards. Yes that's right, Federal Express now FedEx became the largest and still is the largest awards customer of Champion Awards and Apparel.
<br/><br/>
  My Mom's little trophy company tripled in size. What's more important is that they bragged on my Mom and Champion Awards to their customers and vendors. What Mr. McMahon and the FedEx team taught us about service and loyalty will never go unforgotten at Champion Awards. FedEx and its people have been the single greatest influence in our family business for over 30 years now. Can you just imagine how many more stories are similar to mine? This period in Champion's history gave me the courage to leave the corporate world. It showed me my destiny was providing recognition and branded products to great companies like FedEx. Simply put, we are eternally grateful to Mr. Fred Smith and his wonderful team.
<br/><br/>
The Power of One customer can walk in your company and change your life forever. Be ready! Hugs, MB.
