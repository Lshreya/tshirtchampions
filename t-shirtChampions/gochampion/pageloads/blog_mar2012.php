    <p>The loss of a pet is akin to losing a family member. I used to think that idea was a bunch of sentimental rubbish! </p>
    <p> Last  month, I lost Sabrina, my twelve-year old white lab, to old  age.  I've  had many pets. But her passing hurt me the most. She was very  sweet  and most of all loyal. She never left my side on our many walks   along the Wolf River. (Go to www.wolfriverconservancy.org  to join  today)  The cycle of life does continue. We have a new puppy  named  Gracie. Look for an article about what we are learning from the  puppy  soon!</p>
<p> Sabrina's passing not only made me remember all the  pets that have  come before her but also the other &quot;family&quot; members I  lost this year.  When you run a small family business, you are all  family. Whether you  believe it or not, your relatives, long time  employees, short term  employees, customers, and all of their children  and relatives are family  too. Even their pets are family!! It's a fact  that we must empathize  and care for the illnesses and troubles of our  coworkers.  It&rsquo;s a fact  that most people meet their mates and friends  at a work. It&rsquo;s a fact  that we see more of our work family each day  than we do our blood  family. </p>
<p> &quot;Over 70 percent of people leave their jobs because of the way they are led.&quot;  -Norman Drummond.</p>
<p> There are mainly three reasons why we lose team members:</p>
<p> 1. We hire the wrong person. Whether, they are wrong for the job or they just don't fit in with the culture of the company.</p>
<p> 2.  We don't train them enough or correctly. Also different people  take  different amounts of time to become proficient.  You must establish   benchmarks for training and stand by them.</p>
<p> Either way, as the leader, it&rsquo;s my fault! I've finally learned that there is another reason, that I have no control.</p>
<p> 3. People change! Their goals or actions become in direct contrast to the goals of the company or family!</p>
<p> It&rsquo;s  a major plus that they &quot;fit in&ldquo;. &rdquo;Fitting in&quot; is a very tricky   process. Therefore, as a leader, you must care for the chemistry of your   team. I&rsquo;ve always been very proud of trying hard to pick good teams of   people that like each other. I must admit, just when I think I've got  it  right, bam! I lose a member of my team or &quot;family&rdquo;. This year alone,  I  lost seven folks that have been with the company an average of   eleven years. Yes, can you believe that? I'm not really proud of that   fact!</p>
<p> &quot;You put together the best team you can with the  players you have,  and replace those who aren't good enough&rdquo; -Robert  Crandall, American  Airlines</p>
<p> Lets take these particular  seven that left Champion Awards in 2011  for example. The reasons for  leaving are all as different as they were.</p>
<p> 1-2. Team members left to takeover their father's business.</p>
<p> 3.  Team member had to leave town to become caregiver of his mother in   law. (Just found out he is returning in April, and we will gladly   embrace him back.)</p>
<p> 4. Team member with less than a year abruptly decided that &quot;the job&quot; wasn&rsquo;t for him.</p>
<p> 5.  Team member was recruited by a competing company. I must comment   personally here. &quot; We at Champion have provided trained journeymen   screen printers, embroiderers and artists that are still working in   Memphis and around the country for over 35 years now.&quot;  This is simply a   result of being the best!</p>
<p> 6.  Team member lost focus on parts of the job and financial mistakes were made.</p>
<p> 7.  Team  member retiring after 28 years of service. I&rsquo;m so very proud  of this  man. I will write about this person later. I keep crying every  time I  begin!</p>
<p> So, we spend a lot of time, effort and money  teaching, training, even  baby-sitting and they leave. The average  employee of the twenty-first  century will change jobs every four  years.  But, I&rsquo;ve always said, &quot;that  as soon as I get tired of teaching  people, I should close my business&quot;.  My job as a leader is to teach  unremarkable people to do remarkable  things. I resemble that remark.  When I began thirty-five years ago, I  was pretty unremarkable  myself.  Yes, I get frustrated, disappointed,  and even hurt, as a  teacher. (Bless all the full time Teachers out  there). Above all, I  still love the process of seeing a team member &quot;Get  it&rdquo;. The knowledge  that I had some impact on improving a team member&rsquo;s  life is why I do  what I do.</p>
<p> &quot;Best efforts will not substitute for knowledge&quot;.   -Edward Deming, Quality Guru</p>
<p> It  is a known fact that a little turnover is good. If   conducted correctly, turnover can keep existing team members growing. It   can also allow you to bring in new talent!</p>
<p> Let me say  that all terminations, separations, resignations can be  done with grace  and respect.  I believe that was accomplished with these  former team  members. Nevertheless, I wish all former teammates the very  best in  their future. Losing them, still hurts.  Just like losing my  cherished  Sabrina. I'm sure we will see each other again in the future  on a new  river.</p>
