      <p>      Johnny (not his real name) was recently released from Prison to the  halfway house. Champion Awards and Apparel contracts with Transition  Ministries (www.transitionministries.org) to supply temporary labor.  Johnny was one of those guys. I saw him for the first time and was a  little startled. After 35 years of seeing &ldquo;Late Bloomers&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s what I  call those in society who need some help), this man stood out. He was  six foot, eight inches tall and so thin that his tattered jeans hung off  him as though he had just come out of a prison camp. He had sunken  cheeks and black circles under his eyes. His long, stringy, black hair  hung to his shoulders from under a dirty cap pulled down low on his  heavily bearded face. He moved like an elderly person in the mall. He  spoke to no one. He clearly had issues.<br />
        <br />
             Johnny looked like  an old man stuck in the time of his teenage years. Immediately I asked  our screen print director about him. I was told a harrowing story of a  very poor child from the streets of Frayser, a child who had been abused  since he was born. I was told how his mother ended the abuse one night  with a shotgun. His father was dead, and John was convicted as an  accessory to murder. At the age of sixteen, Johnny went to prison as an  adult. He remained there for twenty three years. Yes, from 1988 to 2011,  Johnny's life was frozen in prison.<br />
        <br />
        Imagine, just for a moment,  no school, no first car, no prom, no hanging out at the movies with  friends, no first dates. While Johnny was missing these things that most  of us take for granted, the outside world moved on. When Johnny was  finally released, it was into a world he barely knew existed. Just  think, no mobile phone, no computer, no skills, no job, and perhaps  worst of all, no family, as his mother remains incarcerated to this day.<br />
        <br />
              Let that sink in a minute. What if you had missed the last twenty three  years of your life? It's mind boggling to think of how ignorant (not  stupid) you would be. There are no rehabilitation programs, or very few,  in prison. This is a fallacy that people on the outside use to comfort  themselves. The really sad part was that I was too busy to realize all  that on the first day I saw him. In fact, it took me over three months  of speaking to Johnny regularly to learn who was working for me. He was  manic depressive, a common symptom of abuse. He had no money for  treatment. Hell, he had no money for a haircut, a shave or clothes. He  was a sixteen year old stuck in a thirty nine year old prisoners body!  Scary!!!!! <br />
        <br />
           Fast forward, one year later. Johnny is now a  trained full-time employee. He has skills as a screen printer that can  never be taken from him. His hair is cut, his face is clean shaven; he  has new clothes, a cheerful smile, and brand new attitude. He has  friends, and wouldn&rsquo;t you know, he&rsquo;s a talker! In, fact, he&rsquo;ll talk your  ear off! At the age of forty, we helped Johnny buy his very first car.  He has reconnected with his sister and now Johnny even has his own place  to live. He is not going back to the past. I am very proud of Johnny.  I'm also proud of The Father's House (a halfway house in the  WesTCORE.org family) for giving Johnny and others like him a chance for a  new start. I'm proud of my plant manager, I'm proud of Johnny's  training manager, Kayla, who gave him the tender touch he needed to  Bloom! And me, it just makes me feel good!<br />
        <br />
            Five years ago I  needed temporary employees who would show up for work, and who were  smart enough to be trained quickly, I didn&rsquo;t know, or necessarily care  about helping folks like Johnny. Since then, we have trained over  seventy &quot;Late Bloomers&quot; at Champion. Many of them weren&rsquo;t ready. Many of  them learned from experience and found other opportunities. But seven  of them have been hired full time. They have gained, most for the first  time in their lives, a livable wage and benefits. We could have hired  four times that number, but we are a small company. I have solved my  turnover problem. I finally have what we call a Drama Free, No Cry  Babies allowed Family!  We are all Grateful for our jobs  everyday!!!!!    <br />
        <br />
        I have written about the solution.  I will be  writing more about this problem. This community desperately needs more  business owners to reach out and give &quot;Late Bloomers&quot; a Chance. Contact  WesTCORE.org for more information today. There just may be a &quot;successful  Johnny&quot; in your future!</p>
