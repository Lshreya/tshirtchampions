<strong>Start With Why</strong><br/><br/>
January 2011<br/><br/><br/>




Since I turned 50, the first two weeks in January each of the last 4 years have been very special. I have spent this time recharging my brain & body by going to our home in Heber Springs, Arkansas, called "The Little Red Tree House" <a href="http://www.littleredtreehouse.com">(more info)</a>. It has become a retreat that I look forward to for weeks. Each year, I spend the first weekend with my wife. We sleep very late and rest around the fireplace, then we trout fish on our dock. Then weather permitting, we fish some more. We have a friendly competition of who can catch the most fish. It's just for bragging rights but she has become very good.
<br/><br/>
She was beating me badly this year 14-8 until she got sick. She had to go to bed which gave me about an hour to catch 7 fish to beat her 15-14. My record still stands but it was doubtful there for a moment. This might seem a little unfair but believe me, she has sneaked down to the dock without me many times. Nevertheless, she goes home and I spend the next 10 days just sleeping, exercising, fishing & reading. In this same period of time, I don't speak to another person the entire time except about an hour total.

I do try to accomplish one business decision during this time. This year, my goal was to better define what Champion Awards & Apparel is all about. Why exactly do we do what we do? Why is Champion Special? Through the recommendation of a financial counselor, I began reading "Start with Why" by Simon Sinek. His thesis for the book is based on his Golden Circle. "People don't buy What you do, they buy Why you do it". A failure to communicate Why creates nothing but Stress & Doubt. He goes on to say that the really great companies, Apple, Harley Davidson, Southwest, explain & promote their Why. For many, it becomes a part of the human experience. All of these companies don't sell products & services, they sell attitude and a lifestyle. He asks, "Why did we start doing what we're doing in the first place?
<br/><br/>
As you can only imagine, I was very excited reading this book. My company is very good at explaining What & How we are the best Awards & Apparel supplier in the Region. But to really differentiate ourselves, I have to become better at telling the Why. "Those who truly lead are able to create a following of people, who act not because they were swayed, but because they were inspired" Simon Sinek.
<br/><br/>
Then Why do I do what I do? I have been at this now over 40 years & its time to succinctly explain our cause. Long ago my brother Kenny & I coined the term "The Champion Way". It was a way of explaining to our customers and employees that we were better than our competitors and we were the best at what we did. Somewhere along the way we dropped that mantra. 
<br/><br/>
I have rediscovered my Why. It was there all along. I do what I do for my customers & my employees to simply be "The Best" at what we do. My dream has always been to be the best. I believe if you're the best at something,  you and your team have a real purpose. A real chance to improve our life & our community is all any of us really wants, Right!
<br/><br/>
So I found my Why again! I Vow to explain it better. The Champion Way is the best way. I sincerely hope you know your Why and if you don't, you can still find it!
