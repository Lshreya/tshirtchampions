May 2011<br />
&quot;A hundred years from now it will not matter what my bank account was, the sort of house I lived in, or the kind of car I drove, but the world may be different because I was important in the life of a child.&quot;  (Forest E Witcraft, teacher, scout leader. 1894-1967) <br />
<br />
Please read a vital message below from an angel in our community, my wife. <br />
<br />
The children are running around the apartment complex.  They are seen by neighbors playing in the trash dumpster. The mother is asleep or should I say, in a narcotic induced haze.  The three children are all under the age of ten. They rarely make it to school on time and very often not at all.  Other members of the family are worried when the children are with their mother. The parents are divorcing. The school informs both parents that one of the children is in danger of having to repeat her grade because of absenteeism.  He simply cannot keep up with the work. <br />
<br />
This is an example of a CASA Case.  I am telling you this to make a point. This couple was not from an urban inner city neighborhood.  This couple lived in an affluent Memphis suburb.  The truth is child neglect and abuse happens everywhere.  It knows not race or economic status.  It happens all around us.  As a CASA, I am able to testify on the children's behalf. To have the children placed in a loving, stable environment with the structure needed to make the children feel safe.  I get to know these children by visiting them in their homes, interviewing relatives, having lunch with them at their school or simply meeting them at a park. I got to know the sad aspects of the case by interviewing the teachers, guidance counselors, and other family members close to the case. <br />
<br />
But most of all, I relied on the children to tell me where they wanted to be.  Who they wanted to live with.  &quot;Where do you feel the most safe and happy&quot;?  I asked them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here&quot;! They all three chimed in, in the home of their grandparents with their father.  And that is where they are today.  I'll never forget the mother coming up to me after the case was settled in court and saying &quot;thank you for taking care of my babies&quot;.  She knew she could not take care of her kids.  She knew she needed help. <br />
<br />
I pray that mother has found help and is on the road to recovery from drug abuse.  But my job as a CASA is to focus on the children.  To be their friend. To listen to them and articulate their wants and needs to the court. This is what a CASA does.  This is what I do.  I don't get paid for this.  I am a volunteer. <br />
<br />
In Court, children are often afraid and intimidated.  You can imagine their fear. Their futures are hanging in the balance.  But, they see their &quot;friend&quot; there, and they know that I am going to speak up for them and present their wants and needs to the judge.  The judge will rule in favor of the CASA's recommendations nearly 98% of the time. <br />
<br />
We need your support to continue this very important work. With your help, we can continue to train and place our volunteer advocates in the court system where they can make a difference in a child's future. Without them, it often ends in tragedy. We are very much in danger of losing some of our funds from the public sector &amp; rely heavily on donations from the private sector as well as our fundraising efforts. You can help by becoming a sponsor in our Kickin' It For CASA Kickball Tournament. <br />
