      <p>Ok, I've been discussing the finer points of goal setting, planning and commitment. We all must place a time limit on goals and calendar them. If not, goals just become a list.  I left out one important part. It never stops! It is a way of life. Once you've met one goal you work on another and so forth.</p>
      <p> Imagine that you played basketball for a living. And you played a game everyday for 8 hours. What if you only got paid if you won? Wouldn't you play that game as hard as you could every minute of the time allotted, whether you had a lead or not?  Yes, you would. Why, because if not committed, as little as fifteen minutes can change your whole life! </p>
      <p>More about time management and commitment later.</p>
      <p> The Bowen household recently has a new addition; a puppy named Gracie a Sheltie (toy collie).  I call her Granddog because of all the fuss made over her. Everyone loves puppies. But they do need tender loving care. Which means a big commitment for at least the first 6 months of their puppiness! All this means commitment to caregiving! Suzie is excellent at caregiving, me, not so much. We live in the country on the Wolf River Bottoms. There are predators such as hawks, owls, coyotes, raccoon, possum, and even skunks can be a pain. Our other Sheltie, Bethany, learned the skunk lesson the hard way. About 3 years ago it took us a week to de-skunk the dog! She had to be completely shaved and given at least ten baths!  We believe she knows better now. Also, we have had a couple of cats and ducks go mysteriously missing over the years. Nevertheless, you get the point. &quot;Don't leave a five pound puppy unwatched in the 3 acre back yard&quot;. That was what my wife warned me the day I worked from home and dog sat at the same time. May I add that she warned me ten times!</p>
      <p> Well, I believe dogs are supposed to be able to run and play outside! So naturally while I was on the iPad or iPhone, they were allowed to play outside. I checked on them about every fifteen minutes and called them closer to the deck if they were too far away. Even though we all know that a Hawk can take a squirrel or puppy in about two seconds. I still think it's safe in my backyard. I obviously wasn't so sure though for about fifteen minutes.</p>
      <p> While on the phone, I saw my older dog come in by herself and there was no Gracie behind her. I almost... my pants! I was frantic! Screaming at the top of my lungs, she was not in the backyard, front yard or in the house. I even crawled under the deck.  I was almost in tears. I am a problem solver. Immediately, I was thinking maybe I could go to the breeder in Arkansas and be back before Suzie got home! I was really worried.</p>
      <p> But seriously, I didn't want to call my wife!  Before I called Suzie, I looked in one more place, Suzie's closet. Tucked way back in the corner in an Ugg boot was little Gracie sound asleep. You can only imagine my relief as I picked her up and hugged her as if it was the very last time I would see her. The whole experience was pretty humbling for a fifty-five year old, supposedly tough man. </p>
      <p> The moral of the story: commitment is not a sometime thing; it's an all time thing. It can be exhausting. But I think the alternatives:  procrastination, halfhearted sloppy work, worry, creates more exhaustion and fear in the long run. Believe me I've tried it both ways! </p>
      <p> Just ask Gracie!!<a href="images/gracie.JPG" target="_blank">(Click here to see a picture)</a> Stay committed to what you do as if it's the last time you will ever do it!</p>
      <p> &quot;It was character that got us out of bed, commitment that moved us into action and discipline that enabled us to follow thru!&quot; Zig Zigler</p>
