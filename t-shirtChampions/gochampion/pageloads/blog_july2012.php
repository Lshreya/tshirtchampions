      <p>About a month ago, a customer, (let’s call him John or this can get  confusing) asked me to interview a young man. John allows the guy to  live in one of his rental houses, rent-free. John even pays the guy's  utilities because the guy has no job or means to obtain one. You see,  the guy is a felon. Champion hired the young man because we believe  felons are people too. The young man has successfully completed a month  learning how to print T-shirts. He gets up every morning at 4:00 and  rides the bus from Frayser to our factory in Parkway Village, over 15  miles away. So far, we know that if he can make it to work consistently,  he will do fine. We know this because we have a 1-day probationary  period, more on this later.</p>
      <p>     John asked me in an e-mail the other day &quot;why do you think we  torture ourselves with helping people who sometimes can't help  themselves&quot;. I thought about that for a while before I sent my response.  I replied back, &quot; We try to help these people because it makes us feel  good to do what our parents or grandparents did&quot;. They gave us a chance  to fail and still loved us. Most of these folks didn't have that. That  is as simple an explanation as I can come up with.</p>
      <p>     Let's get something straight; I am not writing about this  subject because it makes Champion, or me, or anyone else look good. I'm  writing about this because it needs to be said.</p>
      <p>     I too was a felon (pot charge) for a short period of time  (charges dropped to misdemeanor) when I was twenty. So I too could have  had this mark for life if my parents hadn't had a good attorney. When my  mom called four years ago and asked me to consider hiring felons right  out of prison, I thought she was crazy. She had begun teaching a program  of business skills to prisoners. Yes, at almost seventy-two years  young, once a month, she drives to a high security prison in Whiteville,  TN, Forrest City, Arkansas, or Tiptonville, TN at 6:00 in the morning.  (We both hate to work in the morning! She is escorted thru a maze of  security checkpoints to a room of sometimes as many as eighty felons who  are trying to get Parole. She teaches each class for at least four  hours and then heads home. She began this program thru her association  with SCORE and is changing lives.</p>
      <p>     So Mom called and asked me to hire this young man named Patrick.  I was not just skeptical; I knew then she was officially certifiable.  But, she went on to remind me of Champion's staffing problem for forty  years. During T-shirt season, March - September, we must add up to ten  or more temporary workers. We have tried it all. We hire from  applications. Unfortunately, everyone in our neighborhood must be rich  or employed. We receive very few applications. We've tried classified  ads, staffing agencies, school kids, relatives, friends; all without  much success. Printing and embroidering apparel is hard, tedious, hot  production work. Most people today would rather work at a McDonalds for $  7.50 an hour than in a factory at more pay, because what we do is hard!  We have five minimum requirements for applicants. Must be able to read,  write and count on a sixth grade level. Employees must consistently,  get to work and have a genuine &quot;Want To Work Attitude&quot;. </p>
      <p>     Mom went on to explain to me about Transitions Ministries and  their program. Men with certain felonies must qualify for parole by  living in a halfway program for a minimum amount of time. They can be in  the houses anywhere from ninety to one hundred and eighty days. This  Halfway house transports late bloomers to and from work. If a particular  Late Bloomer, (my name for all of us slow learners), doesn’t bloom,  then they are not asked back. Most of the time this process takes less  than two days This saves my managers so much valuable time that would  otherwise be wasted on people who don't really want to work. You will  hear more from me about this program in the future. For now, just know  that Champion has six successful fulltime Late Bloomers that just twelve  to forty-eight months ago were wards of the state in prison.</p>
      <p>     Oh, and for Patrick; he's my hero! He has been with us for over  three years. He is our Warehouse Manager and a real leader. He has a  beautiful new daughter, a girlfriend, a home, and a car and is a proud  Late Bloomer.</p>
      <p>     Call me or email me if you would like any more information on  this successful program. Believe me, there are thousands of Late  Bloomers in this community just looking for chance. Please consider  giving Transition Ministries a call. I promise it will make you feel  good. </p>
      <p>By the way, Mom has always been right, you know!</p>
