      <p>We bought four acres about a third of a mile north of the Wolf River  fourteen years ago and built our home on bottom land. I vowed that when  we could afford it, I would plant trees. The land was a farm lake in the  1940's and there were a total six hardwood trees on the property. I  have loved, hated, planned, designed, landscaped, weeded, cut and  gardened many hours on our property. We raised our children and they  were able to camp on the river and walk the 500 acres of Chickasaw  Basin and Wolf River Bottoms behind the house. All was good.  But I  never forgot my vow to plant trees.</p>
      <p>      About three years ago Bill Kinkade, Champion&rsquo;s VP of Sales who  is a real gardener (he has ten acres), introduced me to Ladd Roberts of  Midsouth Tree Farm. We cut a deal, T- shirts for trees. I am beginning  to fulfill that fourteen-year plan. I planted four oaks in 2010. I  planted eight oaks, Bradford Pears and a weeping willow in 2011. I also  began studying Arboretums. The minimum Certified Arboretum in Tennessee,  Level One, is a designated area with thirty or more species of trees  named and permanently labeled with the scientific and common names. The  trees must be over fifteen feet tall and healthy. Did you know there are  only twelve level one Arboretums in West Tennessee? </p>
      <p>      Well naturally, I thought I could build an Arboretum.  So I  just finished planting, mulching, fertilizing, watering, and hugging 57,  five hundred pound trees. Yes, I know I went a little crazy. Over 60  yards of dirt, 30 yards of sand, 1000 lbs. of lime, 25 bags of  fertilizer, 50 2x4 boards, 3000' of rope, 300' of chain, a back hoe (got  stuck) a track hoe (got stuck), another track hoe, neighbors tractor,  four wheeler and trailer, 2 trucks, and 300 man hours were used.  But,  I'm well on my way to completing a fourteen year goal. I think by the  end of 2013, I may become certified. My wife thinks I'm absolutely  certifiable now!</p>
      <p>      What does all this have to do with planning? The old saying  goes &quot;If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.&quot; Well let&rsquo;s change that a  bit to &quot;If you succeed to plan, you plan to succeed.&rdquo; I had over ten  pages of plans for this last operation of planting. There were many  glitches, situations, concerns, and official major problems. But because  of the written plans, we made it thru! Always, always, plan your work  and work your plan.</p>
      <p>      In February, I told you about setting goals. The next step is  placing those goals in a plan. The easiest way to do that is to place  them on a legal pad and then calendar them. We call that Legal Pad  management at Champion.</p>
      <p>&quot;The weakest ink is STRONGER than the loudest words&quot;.  Paraphrase of Chinese proverb</p>
      <p>     I have planned many operations, events, and businesses and used  many tools. A couple of years ago, I read the E-Myth by Michael Gerber.  It is now required reading at Champion. Mr. Gerber uses an outline  titled the Primary Aim to plan your project, business or any goal. (<a href="http://www.gochampion.net/images/primaryaim.doc" _mce_href="http://www.gochampion.net/images/primaryaim.doc">click here for example</a>)  . We now use this tool in each department. We finally have a simple  tool that keeps everyone on the same page. This develops empathy for  better teamwork. When you know my goals and plans and I know yours, we  will succeed.  </p>
      <p>     &quot;Avoid the info gap that comes with verbal transfer. Team  members, when receiving required actions in a uniform manner at the same  time, are more inclined to believe and act upon the information in a  consistent and uniform manner. This will improve morale, quality and  performance of the overall project. -Paraphrase Simon Sinek &quot;Start with  Why&quot;. </p>
      <p>     Remember, there are no guarantees that your plans will work.  Plans are like the limbs of a tree, when one becomes sick, stunts, or  even dies, another limb takes its place. Plans are just like that, when a  plan gets delayed, derailed or fails another plan can take its' place.  Be like a tree, never ever quit! Remember: Plan is short for Plant. Just  plant another plan! </p>
