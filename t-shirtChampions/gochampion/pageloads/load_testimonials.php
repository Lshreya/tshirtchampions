It is always a pleasure to do business with the great customer service personnel at Champion Awards.   When placing my orders, I know that I can always depend on excellent service which includes attention to all the details of the order, quick replies on design ideas, prompt shipment, and arrival of product that is just what I ordered!

...I wanted you to know that I truly admire Champion Awards. Somebody should perform a case study on the company.  To be able to compete in an incredibly difficult market and not only survive, but grow with multiple income streams means somebody is doing something right.  It probably is your focus on customer service and having leaders with vision. The way the company has positioned itself, by building its brand has been a pleasure to watch over the almost 30 years I have been in Memphis. Keep up the good work.

<strong>Byhalia Sports Association</strong><br/>
Having been involved with youth sports for more than 20 years, I am familiar with the headaches than can come from acquiring uniforms. Until I discovered Champion Awards, I dreaded this part of my volunteer work every year - dealing with uniforms that never came or were of such poor quality even the kids weren't happy wearing them. With Champion Awards as my supplier, I know my uniforms will be in on time and will look great. They have indeed been a pleasure to work with.

I want to let you know that Champion has provided excellent service and support to Gameday Baseball.

Go Champion is an appropriate name for your website...why?
We were remarking today that all we have to do is give Bill an idea and in less than 48 hours he and your design team comes back with a graphic that blows us away! Not only are you guys the best in design but before I can pick up the phone to call Bill he calls me. He’s researched our website, knows what we’re doing in the future and has already mapped out a plan to provide us with what we need. Could anyone ever ask for better service? I don’t think it possible. Competitors get after us about doing business locally, but this North Carolina organization goes to Memphis....we go champion!

My company has been ordering t-shirts and other related services from Champion Awards for more than five (5) years and we keep coming back!  Why? – Because they produce a quality product with exceptional art designs, accommodate every one of our business needs and the customer service is superlative. I strongly recommend Champion Awards as a company that any business or individual can partner with if they want quality workmanship, on-time delivery and a wonderful staff to work with.

Thanks for having your crew get all of our  tees together for today.  They look great.  I'm (personally)  particularly thrilled with the new Cat Head blue tees.  They look  spectacular, and folks at the store seemed pretty excited about them. Thanks for everything.

The awards were AWESOME!!  They turned out great and everyone loved the move away from the trophies!  Thanks so much for your help with making that change! The t-shirts were a hit as well.  I had some very macho firemen who made the comment to me that they can actually wear the t-shirt this year…great!

  Lee, I want to  thank you personally for taking care of that yellow tank shirt order. I know it had to be a pain, but the girls really love them. They were exactly what they wanted. Who knows? May be a real order can come out of this! But regardless, I appreciate what you did. Thanks again.
